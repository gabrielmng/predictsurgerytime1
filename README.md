Machine learning to predict elective surgery time: modeling and validation

## Assumptions

* Scheduling and cost management of operating theaters in public hospitals is different from private hospitals;
* Overuse of operating room (more surgeries than expected) after regular times is expensive;
* Underuse of operating room is inneficient;
* Precise prediction of surgery time helps efficient scheduling;
* Machine learning might build more precise models to increase efficiency.

## Initial ideas

* Supervised machine learning: surgery time is the main outcome;
* Need to choose ML algorithm;
* Development of multivariable model;
* Validation of multivariable model with new data;
* Code program to receive data, update model and predict surgery times.

## Writing guide

* TRIPOD
* DMPTool (dmptool.org) to help writing the data management plan
